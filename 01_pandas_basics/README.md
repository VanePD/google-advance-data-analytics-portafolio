## Methods and libraries used 
- Pandas (.read_csv, info, .describe, .shape, .columns)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (basic bar chart)
## Description
This project focuses on understanding raw data by exploring its structure, variables, and basic statistics. 
A basic bar chart is used to support data understanding.
## Data

The dataset used in this project is not included in the repository.

It was obtained from Kaggle:

Daily Minimum Temperatures Dataset  
Source: Kaggle  
Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/XXXXXXXX](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suprematism/daily-minimum-temperatures)

To run the notebook locally:

1. Download the dataset `Daily_Minimum_Temperatures.csv` from Kaggle
2. Create a folder called `data` in the project root directory
3. Place the CSV file inside the `data/` folder
4. Run the notebook `understanding_raw_data.ipynb`

The `data/` directory is excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.
